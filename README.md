# Terra üåè
Capitalism toy-selling video game server emulator from my childhood built in Node and Express. I've called it Terra because that's what the world of UB Funkeys is called! **Not done yet. Please also be aware that the logs WILL be flooded with information while in development, and not a clean user experience.**

# Highlights üåà
- Stupidly simple and secure accounts with bcrypt.
- Fast, portable and no-setup database with SQLite.
- Readable and organised code with extensive comments (from my annoying brain).
- Highly configurable by compartmentalising settings into JSON files.
- Robust error handling and debugging system for further development.

*Note: This is not an exhaustive list, just a frankenstein of A1Emu, UBFunkeysServer, and XmlMessageDoc. There are also a lot of overlapping commands, which will be properly organised in the future. Once these are complete, I will look for any missing niche commands!*

# Why Node? Why not continue Java or C#? üò®
By choosing Node over Java and C#, setup is lightweight and easy. The drawback is that it will not scale as well, but for a Flash game, this is more than fine. Node has many libraries established for web communication like what Terra needs and is a straightforward approach. I am not familiar with the codebases well enough to continue the other projects and a fresh start is more appealing to me.

# Acknowledgements ü•∞
- [A1Emu](https://github.com/GittyMac/A1Emu) (and by extension [UBFunkeysServer](https://github.com/Leahnaya/UBFunkeysServer)) was a reference for the progress tracking and the server emulator. I plan for this to be a "re-implementation" of these projects initially but grow from there.
- [XmlMessageDoc](https://github.com/bluisblu/XmlMessageDoc) has a lot of useful information about the game's packets.
- [OpenFK](https://github.com/GittyMac/OpenFK/), [JPEXS](https://github.com/jindrapetrik/jpexs-decompiler), and [Wireshark](https://github.com/wireshark/wireshark) for testing and reverse engineering the game client.
- Mattel, Radica Games, and Arkadium for creating the game.
